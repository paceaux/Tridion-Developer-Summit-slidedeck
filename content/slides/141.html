			<th>Theme:</th><td>Publish your CSS to a CDN or some public directory. <br />Clients who want CSS to go through a dev-qa-prod process may get cranky over this. </td>
		<tr>
			<th>Styling:</th>
			<td>Most designers aren't prepared for the customization options that are offered. <br />
			Be prepared to answer lots of questions. 
			</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Layering:</th><td> A danger zone.<br /> If HTML5 falls back to Flash (like in an IE browser), the &lt;object>element supercedes all other z-indexing.</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Layout:</th><td>You must provide a height and width using only an integer. <br /> 
			px, %, and em are not accepted<br />
			You can change the unit of measurement with JavaScript&mdash; so long as you used the JavaScript approach.
		</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Fonts:</th><td> Designate any fonts that you want&mdash; even fonts that are included with typekit.</td>
		<tr>
			<th>Color:</th><td>  You must provide color in hexadecimal. RGB, RGBA, and HSLA are not accepted.</td>
