	<p> All you need to know about putting a video on the page is in the distribution information window.</p>

	<p>The iframe and Ajax approach use the URL in the distribution window. </p>

	<p>the JavaScript approach involves copying and pasting the code. </p>


      <figure>
      <img src="images/outlets.png" alt="shot of an outlet" />

      <figcaption>

  		<p>What's easiest for the developer isn't necessarily easiest for the content author.</p>
		<p>Additional interactivity with the video will affect your choice of approach</p>
